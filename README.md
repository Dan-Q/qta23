# QTA23.uk

Hi, Future Dan! Here's the code you wrote for qta23.uk. If you're cloning it and adapting for a future party website, you'll want to:

1. `cp .env.example .env` and edit `.env` appropriately.
2. `docker-compose up` for development.

This repo is public, but it's probably no use to you unless you're Future Dan, sorry.
